## Why

Unicon was created to bring to [Laravel] Blade templates the same seamless
icon integration that the [nuxt/icon] module provides for Nuxt. With Unicon,
users can dynamically fetch icons directly from the [Iconify] API, accessing
over 200,000 icons without needing to install icon sets or manually add
SVGs. This on-demand functionality provides flexible icon usage, while
caching ensures fast and efficient loading for optimized performance.
