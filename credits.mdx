## Iconify

Unicon uses the [Iconify](https://iconify.design) API to offer access to over 200,000 icons. 
This project wouldn't be possible without them, and maintaining servers comes with a cost. 
If you're able, please consider [supporting Iconify](https://iconify.design/sponsors/).

## Unicon Logo

I'm no designer, and I hope you'll forgive me for borrowing this pretty unicorn icon
made by Google as part of the [Noto Emoji icon set](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/noto/).
